I made the tab sheet, but am waithing for APPROVAL

watermark, letterhead, and tab sheet now waiting for APPROVAL

still awaiting APPROVAL, however I have started a new training project. Seym is quite capable to push the button on command around 40% of the time. This seems like fast progress. I am very proud of him. Also, he and the cat like the laserpointer and flies game on my iPad. He learned it yesterday, I showed her it early this afternoon. They both seem to enjoy video games so far.

Reminded him that i need APPROVAL. Anyways, it's the 5th and i gave seymour a second button, so he now has "yeah" and "play". I originally planned on "no" or "nuh-uh", but he seemed to think he was in trouble, even if he hit the button, so I changed it to "play" to help him ask for my iPad, his socks, or his yellow kitty.

2023-03-06, still waiting on David. Seymour seems to make the connection about the buttons, he currently has the "play" button in my room behind my desk and the "yeah!" button (purple) next to the gym cart. I asked him a question, and he hit the button. IDK if he wanted a treat or to communicate "yeah", bit he seems to have known the button would get my attention either way. 

No APPROVAL yet. Seymour hit the buttons by himself a few time today.
