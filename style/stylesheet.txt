I made the tab sheet, but am waithing for APPROVAL

watermark, letterhead, and tab sheet now waiting for APPROVAL

still awaiting APPROVAL, however I have started a new training project. Seym is quite capable to push the button on command around 40% of the time. This seems like fast progress. I am very proud of him. Also, he and the cat like the laserpointer and flies game on my iPad. He learned it yesterday, I showed her it early this afternoon. They both seem to enjoy video games so far.

Reminded him that i need APPROVAL. Anyways, it's the 5th and i gave seymour a second button, so he now has "yeah" and "play". I originally planned on "no" or "nuh-uh", but he seemed to think he was in trouble, even if he hit the button, so I changed it to "play" to help him ask for my iPad, his socks, or his yellow kitty.
